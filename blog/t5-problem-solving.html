     <ul><li>What was a time I got blocked on a simple problem?
       When I was working on a assignment and find something really new to me, I always get blocked.

    </li></ul>

     <ul><li>
       How have I solved a problem in an elegant way?
           My way is like googling first and then I will probably ask my friend.
    </li></ul>


     <ul><li>
       My reflection on how confident I feel using the following problem solving techniques.
       Pseudocode: I have tried this with other objects, and it is very helpful, and I am confident using it.
       Trying Something: I am not fond of this method, as it is very unspecific. When if there is something working, I probably dont know why.
       Rubber Ducky:  This is something i've done very little of, and am not pretty confident using.
       Reading the Error: This is very helpful in dev tools, and im happy to use this everytime I get an error
       Console Logging: This seems pretty usefull in certain situations.
       Googling: This is my first problem solving tool, and I feel very comfortable searching google.
       Asking Peers:This is my first problem solving tool,very comfortable asking my peers.
       Asking Coaches: This is usually my last method as I have almost always solved my issue before needing their guidance.
       Reflection: I reckon this is a nice way of using it.
    </li></ul>



    <ul><li>
      How would I define the array functions .map .filter and .reduce in my own words?
          Map allows you to call a function on every element in an array, and place the matching results in a new array.
          Filter is nearly self explanatory.In its simplist form, you decare a function with certain parameters, and use filter to execute those parameters in your array.
          Reduce changes values in an array to a single value, by applying a function against values in the array.
    </li></ul>
