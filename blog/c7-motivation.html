       How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?

       When we just look at them one by one, all these porspects seem nice. But if we are comparing them one by one, we tend to
       see the advantages and disadvantages of them. If we only consider pressure, it is just like walking in a constant state of peaks and valleys.
       Pressure stands for short to me. All the things tend to return to original place, the constant step. After that, Passion lights the peaceful life,
       we know what we want to do and what we really like is. After the passion step, everything tends to transfer into the purpose step.
       We have lots of purpose and we focus on the certain purpose at the certain time.

      From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,
                What are your core values?
      My core values are integrity, tactfulness, kindness, creativity and growth.

      What do you stand for?
      I stand for freedom for personal life, I stand for the fire to destory the humen limit and
      I stand for being the creator of my life.



    </li></ul>

      How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?
      The meditation exercise is quite profound to me and for resilience ideas, this matches to
      my real life experience as well. I  I've failed at many things in my life,
      but i use those failures to power myself forward, and keep pushing towards my dreams and my goals.
