     <ul><li>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? how did it go?
       Actually no. I have not use any of these techniques yet. But I will probably use them in my future.
    </li></ul>






      <ul><li>Try empathic listening, how did it go?
        I have tried this technique with my friend and it was going pretty well.
        My friend was appreciated me of my behaviour that I was quiet and my saying
        is pretty understanding and empathic.

        How did I find the loving kindness meditation?
        I found this extremely relaxing.

       Political awareness exercise
       When I looked at the first time, I felt like this was a really serious exeercise. But actually when
       I doing this, the point of this exercise is to assume the opposing view is 100 percent reasonable and correct.
