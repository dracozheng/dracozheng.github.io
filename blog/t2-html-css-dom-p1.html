       Boxifying design means to take a design and break it up into boxes.

       By breaking the design up into boxes it helps you work out how you are going to layout the page, starting with the bigger boxes and working down to smaller boxes.

       The box model means to think of your design/layout as individual boxes.

      HTML is what is on your website (headings, lists, tables)

      CSS is what those things look like (borders, colours, font sizes)

      DOM is how you access those things through javascript (getting nodes, adding new elements, changing their style)
