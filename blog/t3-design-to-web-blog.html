       The responsive site: is an approach to web design aimed at allowing desktop webpages to be viewed in response to the size of the device one is viewing with.
       The reason that responsive design is important is that:
       <ul><li>Supporting the multi-device user</li></ul>
       <ul><li>One site to rule them out</li></ul>
       <ul><li>Improved search engine ranking</li></ul>
       <ul><li>Future scalability</li></ul>
    </p>

      It is one of the best strategies to create either a responsive or adaptive design.
      The mobile-first approach is a tenet of progressive enhancement.
      It is the ideology that mobile design, as the hardest, should be done first.
      Once the mobile design questions are answered, designing for other devices will be easier.

      <ul><li> A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.

      In the world of web design, to give a more straightforward definition, a framework is defined as a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site.

      Most websites share a very similar (not to say identical) structure. The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers don’t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided. In this way, frameworks allow us to cut out much of the work and save a lot of time.

      <ul><li> A wireframe(website), also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.
        Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. The purpose is usually being informed by a business objective and a creative idea. The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the website’s content, including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together.
