      <li>Grid based design is trying to break the page into several pieces and each piece represents different box.</li>

      <li>Responsive web design makes the web page look good on all dievices and "RW" only uses for HTML and CSS.</li>

      <li>Semantic structure is trying to break the page up into different sections that represent different purposes.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>

      I actually find the semantic structure is kind hard to process it.
