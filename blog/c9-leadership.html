     <ul><li>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?
       For my final semester, I did a pretty hard paper that had 38.4 average for the midterm test.
       The final exam was not easy as well. Most of my mates felt like we were definatly failed. But
       the result was quite surprising. I got A in the final. Absolutely, lectures imply compassionate pass for most
       people.

      <ul><li>Do the multiplying goodness exercise, how did i find it?
        I felt really good after implying it.

      <ul><li>How does the SCARF model apply to your phase 0 experience? How will it apply to bootcamp?
        The SCARF model is actually applying a positive way. When I was stuggling with some certain things,
        I will probably learn it more deeply after I strugled it. It is tending to help us beter understand
        ourselves. Therefore, it seems to be the useful skill during my bootcamp experience.

      <ul><li>Have a difficult conversation, how did it go?
      It is quite difficult for me. During my conversation with my friend Tom. I
      tried my best to keep the mindfullness. I pretty sure without any guidence
      of this nice book, I would probably going mad during the coversation.
