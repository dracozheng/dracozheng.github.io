     <ul><li>parentheses:

               Parentheses can work as:

               Prioritize order of operations (6 + 6) -6

               Put parameters to a function(A,B)

               These can also group together strings and even functions.
    </li></ul>

     <ul><li>
       "[]" brackets:
       "[]" are square brackets, and they are mostly associated with arrays.
       Arrays can contain bunches of information, and brackets allow you to create arrays, access their data, and manipulate the data inside of the array.
       Brackets can also be used to access and manipulate data inside of an object.
    </li></ul>


     <ul><li>
       "{}" braces:
       Braces are how we store information into blocks of code.
       By storing code this way, we can easily read it, dictate which function its assigned to, and store lots of information.
       Braces may also be used to define object parameters, which can be accessed and manipulated with brackets.
    </li></ul>



    <ul><li>
     "quotes":
     '' single quotes in javascript can be both used for single characters, and strings.
     Mainly used as a way for developers to be lazy and not hit the shift key for double quotes, but can also help with reducing the total number of characters, and there for less memory in the file(although im sure this is a negligible amount of memory)

     "" double quotes are nearly identical to single quotes, except you cant use them both in thhe same string, and double quotes help to keep you computer from getting confused.
     See if you were to pass a string to your computer like 'I like Draco's shells' it would get confused and end the string at Draco, instead of reading to the end of shells. This is because it sees the single quote, and wants to end the string there.
     Now you can get around this by using a \ before the first single quote like this 'I like Draco\'s shells' and tell it ignore that quote, or you could just use double quotes and avoid the hassle, like this "I like Draco's shells"

    </li></ul>
