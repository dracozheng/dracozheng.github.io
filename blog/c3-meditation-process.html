     The process over product concept affecting me is when I am trying to rebuild my
     website. For the first time, I could not change the thing quickly by entering for the real css
     code. But when I keep doing it, it makes me more comfortable now.

     For medidation, I did not know how to perform it before reading the chapter 2.
     Medidation can possibly change the bad mood and stress we currently have.

     I did not have any of the suggested meditation techniques that stand out to me and no musings
