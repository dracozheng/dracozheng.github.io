      What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
        I reckon that they are relatively the same:)
         Being mindfull is the practice of bringing ones attention back to a center.
         Being self aware is being conscious of your current state.

        Which practise did I try between the body scan and journaling, and what was my experience of it?
          I tried the body scan and found it is extremely relaxing, and I can see how this would be a nice practice to get into for the heart of a meditation session.
          I am willing to try the journaling exercise, as the research behind it is convincing enough to give it a go.

      <ul><li> What did I take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
        I agreed with this section actually haha
        Being able to differentiate ourselves from our emotions is really important, otherwise we are creatures that react based on instinct, instead of thought.
